# A word on checking whether a util is installed:
# Technically `command -v $util` is better as we don't need to know where the
# command is installed, but it is a lot slower.
# Pretty much all the utilities here will be in /usr/bin, especially on Arch
# Linux where /bin and /sbin are just symlinks to /usr/bin.
# As such, test -x /usr/bin/${util} works just as well.

# Attach to existing tmux session if not already in one.
# Doing this early prevents the original shell from executing everything
# beneath until the user detaches.
